# DevOps-Course-2024

This repo contains a detailed walkthrough of what I learned throughout this DevOps Course and what are my contributions.

# Technologies Learned
<ul>
  <li><b>Docker</b></li><br>
  <p>Before this course, I had an experience of using docker but I was not familiar with hou it actually worked. I worked on clusters in Ubuntu, but failed to understand the key concepts. After taking this course, I became familiar with the docker environment, the termenologies and the advantages of Docker in modern world. </p>

  <li><b>Kubernetes</b></li><br>
  <p>After learning Docker, I understood that managing containers accross multiple nodes can become cumbersome, and Kubernetes  simplifies operations by ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization across distributed environments.</p>

  <li><b>Ingress</b></li><br>
  <p>I got to know that Ingress simplifies routing traffic using rules while supporting advanced features like load balancing, SSL termination, and path-based routing.</p>

  <li><b>Cloud Services</b></li><br>
  <p>We were introduced to some Cloud Services such as EKS, ECS offered by amazon.</p>

  <li><b>Infrastructure as Code (IAC)</b></li><br>
  <p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using machine-readable configuration files. I learnt about Terraform and Plumi.</p>

  <li><b>Kyverno</b></li><br>
  <p>Falling in the category of Policy as Code, it simplifies policy enforcement with support for validations, mutations, and generation of resources within the cluster.</p>

  <li><b>Knative</b></li><br>
  <p> It simplifies the development and scaling of applications by providing tools for event-driven architecture, autoscaling, and seamless deployment.</p>
</ul>
