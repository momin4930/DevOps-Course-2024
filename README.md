This repo contains a detailed walkthrough of what I learned throughout this DevOps Course and what are my contributions.

# Technologies Learned

  <p>Before this course, I had an experience of using docker but I was not familiar with hou it actually worked. I worked on clusters in Ubuntu, but failed to understand the key concepts. After taking this course, I became familiar with the docker environment, the termenologies and the advantages of Docker in modern world. </p>
